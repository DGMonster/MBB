# Minimap Button Bag Reborn (MBB Reborn)

## Summary
MBB reduces minimap buttons and makes them accessible through a pop out menu.  
Click the MBB button to expand the menu and display the buttons.

Each button that is collapsed into the menu can be reattached to the minimap with **Ctrl + Right Click**.  
The MBB button itself can also be detached from the minimap using **Ctrl + Right Click**.

## Authors
The past version of MBB lost the author's support, which motivated me to fork the project and continue its development.

From what I can see in the source code, the former maintainers and creators are:
- karlsnyder  
- vallantv
- SkunFly 

Many thanks to them for the idea and this awesome project.
